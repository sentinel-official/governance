**Parameter Change Proposal - Node Pricing Parameters**

# Abstract
This proposal aims to **set the minimum node prices on the Sentinel to zero (0)**. The objective is to allow node operators to offer free VPN services when desired, encouraging experimentation, user adoption, and network growth within the Sentinel dVPN ecosystem.

---

# Motivation
At present, the Sentinel enforces a **minimum node price threshold** which restricts operators from setting node prices to zero.
While the minimum price helps prevent spam or non-serious nodes, it also limits flexibility in pricing strategies.

By setting the **minimum node prices to zero**, we can:

- Enable community-driven **free access initiatives** such as trials, education, and outreach.
- Attract **new users** by removing cost barriers to entry.
- Support **research and development** by allowing test and promotional nodes.
- Uphold **decentralization principles** where market dynamics determine price fairness, not protocol-enforced minimums.

## Effect
- Node operators will be allowed to set bandwidth prices as low as zero.
- No minimum enforced by the network.

---

# Rationale
Allowing zero-priced nodes promotes flexibility, experimentation, and adoption:

- Encourages **network decentralization** by lowering entry barriers for operators and users.
- Enables **sponsored or community-funded VPN services**.
- Provides a more **organic pricing environment** determined by supply and demand.

---

# Implementation
This change will be implemented through a **parameter update transaction** on the Sentinel governance module, updating the node price configuration to allow `0` as a valid minimum value.

---

# Risks and Considerations
- **Potential abuse** through unreliable free nodes.
- **Temporary revenue impact** - balanced by potential growth in user base and usage.
- **Governance reversibility** - parameters can be modified again if unintended effects occur.

---

# Conclusion
Setting the minimum node prices to zero will:

- Empower node operators
- Encourage innovation and user growth
- Strengthen the network's decentralization and accessibility

This change reflects Sentinelâ€™s mission to provide **open, private, and censorship-resistant access to the internet**.
